# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide - Agro-Vistara

This guide will help you deploy Agro-Vistara to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

1. âœ… GitHub account with repository access
2. âœ… Netlify account (free tier works fine)
3. âœ… Supabase project set up
4. âœ… OpenWeatherMap API key

## Step-by-Step Netlify Deployment

### Method 1: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

#### 1. Connect to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click **"Add new site"** â†’ **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select the **`agro-vistara`** repository

#### 2. Configure Build Settings

In the deployment configuration screen, enter:

- **Branch to deploy:** `main`
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`

Click **"Show advanced"** and add environment variables.

#### 3. Add Environment Variables

Click **"Add environment variable"** and add each of these:

| Variable Name | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Supabase project ID |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Supabase anon/public key |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://your-project.supabase.co` |
| `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key |

**Where to find these values:**
- **Supabase values**: Go to your Supabase project â†’ Settings â†’ API
- **OpenWeatherMap key**: [OpenWeatherMap API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)

#### 4. Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
3. Your site will be live at a random Netlify URL (e.g., `random-name-12345.netlify.app`)

#### 5. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Follow the instructions to configure your DNS

### Method 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Initialize Netlify site
netlify init

# Follow the prompts:
# - Create & configure a new site
# - Choose your team
# - Site name: agro-vistara
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Publish directory: dist

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Method 3: Drag & Drop Deploy

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the project locally
npm run build

# The build output will be in the 'dist' folder
# Go to Netlify Dashboard
# Drag and drop the 'dist' folder to deploy
```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Set up Redirects (Already configured in `netlify.toml`)

Our `netlify.toml` file handles:
- SPA routing redirects
- Security headers
- Service worker caching
- Asset optimization

### 2. Enable HTTPS (Automatic)

Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificates. Your site will be available via HTTPS.

### 3. Configure Supabase Redirect URLs

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **URL Configuration**
3. Add your Netlify URL to **Site URL** and **Redirect URLs**:
   ```
   https://your-site-name.netlify.app
   ```

### 4. Test the Deployment

Visit your Netlify URL and test:
- âœ… User authentication (sign up/login)
- âœ… Weather widget loads
- âœ… All pages accessible
- âœ… Offline mode works
- âœ… Voice assistant functions
- âœ… Data saves to Supabase

## Continuous Deployment

Netlify is configured for automatic deployments:

- **Push to `main`** â†’ Automatic production deploy
- **Pull requests** â†’ Deploy previews automatically created
- **Build logs** â†’ Available in Netlify dashboard

## Environment Variables Management

To update environment variables after deployment:

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Edit or add new variables
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Trigger a new deploy: **Deploys** â†’ **Trigger deploy** â†’ **Deploy site**

## Build Optimization

Our build is optimized with:
- âœ… Vite code splitting
- âœ… Tree shaking (unused code removal)
- âœ… Asset minification
- âœ… Image optimization
- âœ… Service worker pre-caching

**Expected build time:** 2-3 minutes  
**Expected bundle size:** ~500KB (gzipped)

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Enable Netlify Analytics (Optional)

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Analytics**
2. Enable **Netlify Analytics** for visitor insights

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor your site with:
- [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
- Netlify built-in analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error: Missing environment variables**
- Solution: Double-check all 4 environment variables are set correctly

**Error: Build command failed**
- Solution: Run `npm run build` locally to identify the issue
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)

### Site Loads but Features Don't Work

**Weather widget not loading**
- Check OpenWeatherMap API key is valid
- Verify API key has not exceeded rate limits

**Authentication fails**
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check Supabase redirect URLs include your Netlify domain

**Offline mode not working**
- Clear browser cache and service workers
- Redeploy the site to update service worker

### Performance Issues

**Slow initial load**
- Enable Netlify CDN (automatic)
- Optimize images before uploading
- Check Supabase database indexes

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to a previous version:

1. Go to **Deploys** in Netlify dashboard
2. Find the working deployment
3. Click **"Publish deploy"** to restore it
